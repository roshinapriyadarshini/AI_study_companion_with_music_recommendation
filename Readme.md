🔍 Overview
📖 Learning + Relaxation in one app: Upload notes, generate questions, and let AI explain concepts. At the same time, let your webcam detect your mood and instantly play music that matches your vibe.

⚡ Core Idea: "Your AI-powered study buddy with the perfect playlist."

✨ Features
🧠 Study Assistant
Q&A Generator: Converts raw text or extracted text (via OCR) into structured question-answer pairs using Google Gemini LLM.
Summarization: Quickly condenses long passages into crisp summaries.
OCR: Extracts text from uploaded images/screenshots for instant learning.
🎵 Mood-Based Music Companion
Live Emotion Detection: Uses a CNN + OpenCV to classify emotions (happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.) in real time.
Spotify Playlist Integration: Fetches playlists that align with your detected emotional state.
Webcam Streaming Overlay: See your live video feed with emotion labels on-screen.
💬 AI Chatbot
Powered by Google Gemini AI.
Natural conversational interface for answering questions, explaining concepts, or general chat.

5. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API keys.

# Spotify API
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

# Google Gemini
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
6. Run the App
Native
python run.py
Docker
# Build the image
docker build -t notethenote .

# Run the container
docker run -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env notethenote
The app will be running at 👉 http://127.0.0.1:5000

🎮 Usage
Of course. Here is a three-point summary for each core feature, perfectly suited for your README.md file.

Emotion-Based Music Recommendation 🎶
Real-Time Face Detection: The application uses OpenCV to access your webcam, detecting and isolating your face from the video stream frame-by-frame.
AI Emotion Analysis: A pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) analyzes the detected face to classify your real-time emotion (e.g., happy, sad, neutral).
Dynamic Playlist Curation: The detected emotion is sent as a query to the Spotify API, which returns curated music playlists that match your current mood.
Study Assistant 🧠
Versatile Input: It processes information either from direct text input or by using Tesseract OCR to automatically extract text from any uploaded image.
Intelligent Content Generation: The extracted text is sent to the Google Gemini API, which generates a concise summary and a comprehensive list of question-and-answer pairs.
Structured Output: The AI-generated study material is neatly formatted and displayed on the results page, creating an instant study guide.
AI Chatbot 💬
User Interaction: You can type any question or statement into a simple chat interface.
Direct API Call: Your message is sent directly to the Google Gemini API to be processed for a conversational response.
Instantaneous Replies: The model generates a relevant, human-like answer that is immediately displayed back in the chat window.
🛠 Troubleshooting
Webcam not detected → Allow browser permissions for the camera.
Model missing → Ensure .json + .h5 files are inside the /model directory.
Spotify auth error → Double-check your client credentials in the .env file.
Tesseract not found → Ensure Tesseract is installed correctly and its executable is in your system's PATH.
🚀 Future Plans
🔑 User authentication and personalized dashboards.
🗄 Database integration (e.g., PostgreSQL) to save user history.
☁️ Cloud deployment to a platform like AWS, GCP, or Heroku.
📊 Enhanced analytics for study sessions and mood patterns.
